## :globe_with_meridians: User History

Work on an application that encrypts texts, so you will be able to exchange secret messages with other people who know the secret of the encryption used.

The encryption "keys" we will use are as follows:

* The letter "e" is converted to "enter".
* The letter "i" is converted to "imes".
* The letter "a" is converted to "ai".
* The letter "o" is converted to "ober".
* The letter "u" is converted to "ufat".

<br>

## How to Use

1. Encrypt a Message:
* Enter your text into the input field.
* Click the "Encrypt" button.
* The encrypted message will appear in the output section.

2. Decrypt a Message:
* Enter the encrypted text into the input field.
* Click the "Decrypt" button.
* The original message will be displayed in the output section.

3. Copy to Clipboard:
* After encryption or decryption, click the "Copy" button to copy the result to your clipboard.
