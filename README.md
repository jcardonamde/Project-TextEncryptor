In this opportunity I have developed a stylized text encryptor under the theme of matrix. This application has the function to encode and decode text messages in a simple way. With the aim of exchanging information with other people in a safe and fun way.

Developed with HTML5, CSS, Boostrap 5 for the frontend and JavaScript in the encryption / decryption functions.

## **User History**

Work on an application that encrypts texts, so you will be able to exchange secret messages with other people who know the secret of the encryption used.

The encryption "keys" we will use are as follows:

* The letter "e" is converted to "enter".
* The letter "i" is converted to "imes".
* The letter "a" is converted to "ai".
* The letter "o" is converted to "ober".
* The letter "u" is converted to "ufat".
